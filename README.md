# jsonmark

Parse markdown to a very simple json-format that can then be stringified back to markdown

## Installation

```
npm install jsonmark
```

## Example

```javascript
var jsonmark = require('./jsonmark')
  , markdown = '#header\n\nHello, world!'

console.log('this is the json-format:')
console.log(JSON.stringify(jsonmark.parse(markdown), null, '  '))
console.log()
console.log('and it can be parsed back to markdown:')
console.log(jsonmark.stringify(jsonmark.parse(markdown)))
```

### Output
would then print the following to stdout

```
this is the json-format:
{
  "order": [
    "header"
  ],
  "content": {
    "header": {
      "head": "#header",
      "body": "Hello, world!"
    }
  }
}

and it can be parsed back to markdown:
#header

Hello, world!
```
